# Pinterest-Screensaver
 
 Pinterest Screensaver application.
 
 The premise of the app is that you can turn any Pinterest Board that you have into an in browser screen saver. When I was looking for inspiration at work I would frequently browse Pinterest and thought it would solve an interesting situation by havinga constant source of design inspiration on one of my monitors.
 
 The project was originally conceived using jQuery and JavaScript. After a few months later and hopefully some development maturity I am going to remake the application using Angular.
